# Project 3: Language modelling and Transformers

## Description

In this project, we will build both a baseline bigram language model and try to improve the performance of the model with a transformer-based language model. Note that since we are resource constrained we cannot train a large enough model to convergence to see very good results. We will train these models on the [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) dataset and try to improve the generation abilities of the language model.

To compare the performance of a reasonable trained model vs the baseline we will provide you with model weights for a 20M parameter model trained on the same dataset.

You will write and run generation for both models and compare the results.

As a bonus you can also attempt to train the transformer model on the dataset. Note that this will be extremely slow on CPU but should be fun if you have access to a GPU.

Happy Coding!

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy torch tiktoken wandb einops
```

where:

1. `numpy` is a library for numerical computing. **Required**.
2. `torch` is the PyTorch library. **Required**.
3. `tiktoken` is a library for tokenizing text data. **Required**.
4. `wandb` is the Weights and Biases library for tracking experiments, it is optional but recommended.
5. `einops` is a library for tensor manipulation, it is fantastic and I highly recommend it but is not required for this project.

You are not allowed to use any other external libraries (like `transformers` or `torchtext`) for this project.
Please come talk to us if there is a particular library you would like to try out.

 Also please do not import any other functionality from torch than is already imported in the starter code. Minor imports (like torch.var or torch.std) are allowed but not big ones like (nn.TransformerEncoderLayer).

## Dataset

Dataset is downloaded and split into train and validation for you check the `data` folder.

## Pretrained Models

Note: Pretrained models will be provided in the zipped file, if not you can download them from the link below.

Download all pretrained models from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g09qUM9WibdfQVgkj6IAj8K2S3SGwc91/view?usp=sharing)

And add the folder to the root directory. That is all the pretrained models should be in the `pretrained_models` folder in the MiniGPT folder.
